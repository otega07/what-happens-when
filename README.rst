### What Happens When the 'g' Key is Pressed?

#### Step 1: Physical Key Press
- Pressing the "g" key on your keyboard closes an electrical circuit.
- This action causes a mechanical contact to touch a conductive material, completing the circuit.

#### Step 2: Electrical Signal
- The closed circuit allows an electrical current to flow through the keyboard's circuitry.
- The current is detected by the keyboard's controller, a small computer chip that processes keyboard input.

#### Step 3: Keyboard Controller
- The keyboard controller receives the electrical signal and translates it into a digital code (e.g., the ASCII code for "g", which is 0x67).
- The controller sends the digital code to the computer's processor through a communication protocol (e.g., USB or PS/2).

#### Step 4: Processor Interrupt
- The processor receives the digital code and interrupts its current tasks to process the keyboard input.
- The processor executes an interrupt handler routine, which determines the type of input (in this case, a key press).

#### Step 5: Operating System
- The interrupt handler routine notifies the operating system (OS) of the key press event.
- The OS processes the event, determining which application should receive the input (in this case, the web browser).

#### Step 6: Application Processing
- The OS sends the key press event to the web browser application.
- The browser receives the event and updates its internal state to reflect the new input (the "g" character).

And that's what happens when the "g" key is pressed! From physical switch to digital signal, the process involves a combination of electrical and digital signals, keyboard controller processing, processor interrupts, and operating system and application processing.
